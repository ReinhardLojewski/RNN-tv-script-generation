Udacity project for RNN creation. This repository is my solution to the tv script generation project from Udacity.



#### Keywords:
* Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
* Tensorflow
* Embeddings
* Word2Vec

### Introduction
In this project, I learned to program a RNN from  scratch and used it to generate my own TV script for the series Seinfeld.  
A dataset of scripts from 9 seasons. The Neural Network will generate a new, fake TV script.

If you want to clone this repository to your computer use:

`git clone https://github.com/ReinhardLojewski/RNN-tv-script-generation.git`

This way you can stay up to date with any changes I make by pulling the changes to your local repository. In order to get the model running navigate to the notebook and follow the instructions.  

`jupyter notebook dlnd_tv_script_generation.ipynb`


```python
